**I don't have a rental agreement. Help?**

You can [fill this form](https://forms.gle/UtJDzGAjYzLY3s7k7) to get a postcard as an address proof.

**Why is there a deadline of 9th December?** 
{: #deadline}

Election Commission has published the Karnataka [Draft Electoral Rolls](https://voters.eci.gov.in/download-eroll?stateCode=S10) for the 2024 General
Elections on October 27th. The final rolls are expected to be published around early January.

So any submissions made today will have less than 3 weeks to be processed. For
Forms submitted beyond 9th, the chances for the submission to be processed in
time for the 2024 General Elections are much lower.

**Some links are broken?**

Yes, we wanted to launch early.

**How can I help?**

Share this with your friends and family. Get them to register to vote. Reach out if they face any issues.

**The map says my address is not in Bangalore**

The map only tracks BBMP constituencies, so a few Bengaluru Rural/Urban constituencies that aren't
under BBMP are not covered. You can still use the form to register to vote, and check your
address against <https://kgis.ksrsac.in/pollinginfo/> for now.

**I don't have a pre existing voter Id, help?**

Fill Form 6 with the same details instead of Form 8. Make sure you were born
before 1st January 2006, or you will be too young to vote this time.

**Bangalore isn't a tehsil/taluka**
Yes, but the boundaries for Bangalore's various talukas are unclear, and it is okay
to just submit Bangalore. If you have any suggestions on how to get a taluka from
an address, please let us know.
