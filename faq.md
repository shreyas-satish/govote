### I don't have a rental agreement

You can [fill this form](https://forms.gle/UtJDzGAjYzLY3s7k7) to get a postcard as an address proof.

### Why is there a deadline of 9th December {#deadline}

Election Commission has published the Karnataka [Draft Electoral Rolls](https://voters.eci.gov.in/download-eroll?stateCode=S10) for the 2024 General
Elections on October 27th. The final rolls are expected to be published around early January.

So any submissions made today will have less than 3 weeks to be processed. For
Forms submitted beyond 9th, the chances for the submission to be processed in
time for the 2024 General Elections are much lower.
